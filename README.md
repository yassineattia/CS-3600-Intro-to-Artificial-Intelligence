In this project, the Pacman agent had to find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. We build general search algorithms and applied them to Pacman scenarios.

Project2: https://bhrolenok.github.io/teaching/cs-3600-spr2019/project2/index.html
This project covers MDPs and Reinforcement Learning approaches to solving problems in environments with action stochasticity.


Project3: https://bhrolenok.github.io/teaching/cs-3600-spr2019/project3/index.html
This project covers inference and filtering in Bayesian Networks.

Project 4: https://bhrolenok.github.io/teaching/cs-3600-spr2019/project4/index.html
This project covers Machine Learning with Decision Trees.
